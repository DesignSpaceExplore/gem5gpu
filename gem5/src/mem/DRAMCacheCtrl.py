# A single HMC-2500 x32 model based on:
# [1] DRAMSpec: a high-level DRAM bank modelling tool
# developed at the University of Kaiserslautern. This high level tool
# uses RC (resistance-capacitance) and CV (capacitance-voltage) models to
# estimate the DRAM bank latency and power numbers.
# [2] A Logic-base Interconnect for Supporting Near Memory Computation in the
# Hybrid Memory Cube (E. Azarkhish et. al)
# Assumed for the HMC model is a 30 nm technology node.
# The modelled HMC consists of 4 Gbit layers which sum up to 2GB of memory (4
# layers).
# Each layer has 16 vaults and each vault consists of 2 banks per layer.
# In order to be able to use the same controller used for 2D DRAM generations
# for HMC, the following analogy is done:
# Channel (DDR) => Vault (HMC)
# device_size (DDR) => size of a single layer in a vault
# ranks per channel (DDR) => number of layers
# banks per rank (DDR) => banks per layer
# devices per rank (DDR) => devices per layer ( 1 for HMC).
# The parameters for which no input is available are inherited from the DDR3
# configuration.
# This configuration includes the latencies from the DRAM to the logic layer of
# the HMC
